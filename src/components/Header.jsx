                I decided to become a software developer because I love learning
                different programming languages and using them to solve problems
                and to build different applications. Recently, I have trained to
                become a full-stack software developer at Northcoders. It was an
                amazing experience pair-programming with my peers on small
                sprints and working on my solo and group projects, demostrating
                my skills as an adaptable learner.
